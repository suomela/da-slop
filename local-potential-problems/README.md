# Local potential problems

## Context

Label the nodes with labels 0 and 1, call an edge between a node with label 0 and a node with label 1 a cut edge, then Locally Optimal Cut (LOC) is the problem of assigning 0s and 1s in such a way, that no node can (single handedly) increase the number of cut edges, by changing its label. Note that if a 0/1-assignment is not a solution, then there must exist an "unhappy" node with strictly less than half of its adjacent edges being cut edges.

LOC is just one example of a problem where we can prove that a solution always exists using a simple potential argument. Start with an arbitrary solution and let $b<|E|$ be the number of non-cut edges. If the solution is not correct, then there exists an unhappy node that we can 'flip' to decrease the number of non-cut edges. Hence after doing this finitely often we obtain a valid solution. 

Local potential problems are essentially all problems for which we can do such an argument, that is there is some global potential that is just the sum over all local potentials. If the solution is not correct, then a node can make a small local change to improve the global potential. 

## New result

Tight $ \tilde{O}(\min\{\Delta , \sqrt{n}\})$ upperbound for LOC.

$ \tilde{O}(\min\{K\Delta^r , \sqrt{Kn}\})$ upperbound for generic local potential problems with radius $r$ and local scale $K$.

$\Omega(\Delta^{r+1})$ Lowerbound for LOC with a larger radius ($r=1$ gives the usual LOC), showing that the $\Delta$ dependence in the generic upperbound is tight.

## Prior work

The most important prior work is ([Balliu, Boudier, d'Amore, Kuhn, Olivetti, Schmid, Suomela, PODC 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12038).

They already provide the $\Omega(\min\{\Delta , \sqrt{n}\})$ lowerbound for LOC, but their upperbound is essentially $\min\{\Delta , \sqrt{n})\}^2$.

Similarly, their generic upperbound is $O(\Delta^{2r} \cdot \text{poly}(\log n))$, so roughly the aquare of the above improvement.

## Confidence

The main improvement is just an imprved analysis of the original work. I tried to get this to work for roughly a month, but did not find the right formulation. The new sequence lemma (which is the main new ingredient) is exactly what i would have expected it to be. So i am confident in both upperbounds.

I have not verified the lowerbounds, but they should also be a straightforward adaptation of the existing lowerbound construction.

## Thanks

Thanks to Francesco d'Amore for first prompting GPT about this.
